[CloudOps](http://www.cloudops.com) is excited to host the first [Apache CloudStackâ„¢](http://cloudstack.apache.org)
Collab conference of 2016 on June 1-3 2016 in beautiful
[Montreal, Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal). This conference is
aimed at developers and users to discuss and evolve the software and its
functionality. It has been a while since the community has gotten together to
collaborate and learn, so we will be getting everyone together in Montreal in
June. Montreal is active and beautiful this time of year, so we recommend
planning an extra day to take advantage of this amazing city. Part talks, part
workshops, this event will present a great opportunity for attendees and
sponsors alike. 
<br><br>
We plan to focus the hackathon on Continuous Integration, testing and working
through questions around GitHub pull requests. If you are interested in
presenting at the event, please submit your ideas [here](https://goo.gl/r5Wmjk).
The cut off date to submit a talk is Friday, May 6th.
